# drowsiness-detection
In a country where road accidents claim nearly three lives every minute, the report related to sleepy drivers has underlined the need for an enhanced system which can
detect and alert the driver. The System detects faces using the HOG algorithm and
further detects if the eyes are open or closed using the EAR ratio of eyes. Every
driver should have a drowsiness detection system in his vehicle so that he can be
safe and secure from road accidents. The truck drivers, car passengers, taxi drivers, all should be
made aware about this system.So that, they can manage to get help through it.
Modules covered :
1. Eye Detection Module
In this module, the system detects the face and later on the eyes. Once the
detection is done successfully, the system extracts the eye region which is
required for the next module.
2. Drowsiness Score Detection Module
In this module, using mathematical operations, the system calculates the
drowsiness score which is then compared with a threshold . If the score is
less than the threshold then the system will alert the driver with the help of
the alarm signal.
